    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  What are mental health problems?
  </h1>
  <br><br>

  <p id="allinall">
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  In many ways, mental health is just like physical health: everybody has it and we need to take care of it.<br> <br>

  Good mental health means being generally able to think, feel and react in the ways that you need and want to live your life. But if you go through a period of poor mental health you might find the ways you're frequently thinking, feeling or reacting become difficult, or even impossible, to cope with. This can feel just as bad as a physical illness, or even worse.<br> <br>

  Mental health problems affect around one in four people in any given year. They range from common problems, such as depression and anxiety, to rarer problems such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.<br><br>

  Our website likes to raise awareness for some mental health problems that we'll discuss suggesting some ways to solve them!
  <br><br><br>

  <h2>1-Depression</h2>      <center> <img src="./depression.png" style="width:160px; height:120px;"> </center>

    <p id="deppressed">
         Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person’s ability to function at work and at home.

Depression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:
         <ul id="symptoms1">
           <li>Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed</li>
           <li>Changes in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting</li>
           <li>Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much</li>
           <li>Feeling worthless or guilty</li>
         </ul>
   </p>

   <h2>2-Social Anxiety</h2>   <center> <img src="./social.jpg" style="width:130px; height:150px;"> </center>
<p id="socanxiety">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Social anxiety disorder or social anxiety is an excessive emotional discomfort, fear, or worry about social situations. The individual is worried about being evaluated or scrutinized by other people, and there is a heightened fear of interactions with others.
<br> <br>
Many people feel nervous in certain social situations, such as when giving a presentation, going out on a date, or taking part in a competition. This is normal and would not qualify as social anxiety disorder.
<br><br>
Social anxiety becomes a medical condition when everyday social interactions cause excessive fear, self-consciousness, and embarrassment.

Trivial, everyday tasks, such as filling in a form with people around and eating in public places or with friends, may become highly stressful for somebody with social anxiety.
<br><br>
it's symptoms can vary and include:
    <ul id="symptoms2">
      <li>avoiding situations where the individual feels they may be the center or focus of attention</li>
      <li>dread concerning how they will be presented to others</li>
      <li>a blank mind in social situations that cause anxiety</li>
      <li>refraining from certain activities or talking to people because of a fear of embarrassment</li>
